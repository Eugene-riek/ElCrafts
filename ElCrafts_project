ElCraft:

Connecting Craftsmen with Clients

ElCraft is a web platform designed to bridge the gap between skilled craftsmen and potential clients. Our mission is to empower both parties by creating a seamless and efficient connection point.

Project Description

ElCraft will be a user-friendly website where:

Craftsmen: can create profiles showcasing their skills, experience, and portfolio. They can also manage their project availability, receive client inquiries, and communicate directly.

Clients: can browse through a network of qualified craftsmen based on their specific needs. They can filter profiles by skillset, location, and budget to find the perfect match for their project. The platform will also facilitate communication and project management for a smooth experience.
